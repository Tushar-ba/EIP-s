# EIP-1363: Payable Token Standard Documentation

## Overview

EIP-1363 introduces the concept of "Payable Tokens" - an extension of ERC-20 that allows tokens to notify receiving contracts about token transfers and approvals. This enables token transfers to behave similarly to Ether transactions, where contracts can execute code upon receiving tokens.

## Problem Statement

Standard ERC-20 tokens have several limitations:

1. No way to execute code after a transfer
2. Requires two transactions for token payments (approve + transferFrom)
3. No standardized way to react to incoming token transfers
4. Limited interaction capabilities between tokens and smart contracts

## EIP-1363 Solution

The standard adds callback functionality to ERC-20 tokens through:

1. Transfer and call in a single transaction
2. Approval and call in a single transaction
3. Standardized interfaces for receiving contracts
4. Safety mechanisms to prevent failed callbacks

## Contract Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. ERC1363Token Contract

```solidity
contract ERC1363Token is ERC20 {
    bytes4 public constant ERC1363_RECEIVED;
    bytes4 public constant ERC1363_APPROVED;
}
```

### Key Functions

#### Transfer Operations

1. `transferAndCall(address to, uint256 amount)`

   - Combines transfer with callback
   - Parameters:
     - `to`: Recipient address
     - `amount`: Token amount
   - Returns: Boolean success
2. `transferAndCall(address to, uint256 amount, bytes memory data)`

   - Extended version with custom data
   - Additional parameter:
     - `data`: Custom callback data
3. `transferFromAndCall` variants

   - Similar to transferAndCall but uses allowance
   - Requires prior approval
   - Includes data parameter option

#### Approval Operations

1. `approveAndCall(address spender, uint256 amount)`

   - Combines approve with callback
   - Parameters:
     - `spender`: Approved address
     - `amount`: Approved amount
2. `approveAndCall(address spender, uint256 amount, bytes memory data)`

   - Extended version with custom data
   - Includes additional data parameter

### Receiver Interfaces

#### IERC1363Receiver

```solidity
interface IERC1363Receiver {
    function onTransferReceived(
        address operator,
        address from,
        uint256 value,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external returns (bytes4);
}
```

#### IERC1363Spender

```solidity
interface IERC1363Spender {
    function onApprovalReceived(
        address owner,
        uint256 value,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external returns (bytes4);
}
```

## Advantages of EIP-1363

1. **Efficiency**

   - Single-transaction token payments
   - Reduced gas costs
   - Streamlined contract interactions
2. **Security**

   - Standardized callback interface
   - Built-in safety checks
   - Revert mechanisms for failed callbacks
3. **Flexibility**

   - Custom data in transfers
   - Multiple implementation options
   - Compatible with existing ERC-20 functions
4. **Integration**

   - Easy to implement in existing systems
   - Backward compatible with ERC-20
   - Standardized interface for exchanges

## Use Cases

1. **Payment Systems**

   - Automatic order processing
   - Subscription services
   - Payment routing
2. **DeFi Applications**

   - Atomic token swaps
   - Lending protocols
   - Yield farming
3. **Gaming**

   - In-game purchases
   - Item trading
   - Reward distribution

## Implementation Considerations

### Security

1. **Callback Safety**

   - Implement reentrancy guards
   - Validate return values
   - Handle failed callbacks
2. **Gas Limitations**

   - Monitor callback gas usage
   - Implement gas limits
   - Handle out-of-gas scenarios
3. **Contract Validation**

   - Check contract existence
   - Verify interface support
   - Handle invalid implementations

### Best Practices

1. **Implementation**

   - Use OpenZeppelin contracts when possible
   - Follow checks-effects-interactions pattern
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
2. **Testing**

   - Test all callback scenarios
   - Verify gas consumption
   - Check edge cases
3. **Deployment**

   - Validate constructor parameters
   - Verify interface implementations
   - Document deployment process

## Common Patterns

### Basic Transfer with Callback

```solidity
// Transfer tokens and trigger callback
token.transferAndCall(receiver, amount);

// Transfer with custom data
token.transferAndCall(receiver, amount, abi.encode(customData));
```

### Approval with Callback

```solidity
// Approve tokens and trigger callback
token.approveAndCall(spender, amount);

// Approve with custom data
token.approveAndCall(spender, amount, abi.encode(customData));
```

## Comparison with Other Standards

   - Additional callback options

## Conclusion

EIP-1363 represents a significant improvement in token functionality, particularly for contract interactions and automated systems. While it introduces additional complexity, the benefits of single-transaction operations and standardized callbacks make it valuable for many applications, especially in DeFi and gaming contexts.
